### Jonathan's Notes

Today is Monday,It's a sunny day,we have a weekly meeting in the morning,the boss pointed out some problems in our work,the topic is 'PDCA',we should be have a closed loop in our daily work,the plan is so important in work.

I spend the whole day to solve some issues,rewrite some code that i wrote before,I feel a sense of accomplishment,so,i get off the work at eight o'clock,it makes me happy.

I miss my father so much when i see the video that a dark and wrinkled man sitted on the ground, He looks so tired,but he was still smiling,my father works hard in my hometown alone,I guess he must be very tired,Day after day,Year after year.

I will succeed,Sure will,In the near future!

From this moment on,I hope you can get rid of your emotional obsession,Like forrest gump,keep on running!
