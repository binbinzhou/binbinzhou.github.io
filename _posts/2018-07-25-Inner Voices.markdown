### My heart's voices

When you see the article here,may be you will excited and sad,because you find my secret,i will write some story here that i never told anyone,i don't know who can i tell these thing,In the eyes of others,i should be a positive boy,i should love life,love my family,my friends.

But things are not like you want,recently,i feel so bad,because i think i'm depressed,i don't know the reason,i just dream every night,it interferes with my work and life,make me so tired.

My parents wanted me to get married early, but I never met the girl I loved,I spent a lot of time on make friend with their friend's daughter or my big sister's friends,Although these girls are about my age,but there were many differences in communication,i'm so tired.

I'm under a lot of pressure,I'm out of breath,even thought i had thinking of ending my life,but that's just thinking,i can't let my parents go,they are the most impotant person in my life.what can i do? i love my parents so much.and i can't against my heart. i want freedom.
